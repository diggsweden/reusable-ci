## Available Components

This document describes individual workflow components that can be used standalone or combined with orchestrators.

**When to use components:**
- You need fine-grained control over the release process
- You want to create custom workflows
- You're integrating with existing CI/CD pipelines

**When to use orchestrators:**
- You want a complete, ready-to-use release workflow
- You prefer convention over configuration
- You're starting a new project (recommended)

See [Workflow Guide](workflows.md) for orchestrator documentation and [Artifacts Reference](artifacts-reference.md) for configuration.
