   ```bash
   # For bash - add to ~/.bashrc
   eval "$(mise activate bash)"

   eval "$(mise activate zsh)"

   # For fish - add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   mise activate fish | source
   ```

   Then restart your terminal.
3. Install pipx (needed for reuse license linting):

   ```bash
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt install pipx
   ```

4. Install project tools:

   ```bash
   mise install
   ```

5. Run quality checks:

   ```bash

## Workflow Refactor Checklist

When changing workflows or workflow helper scripts:

1. Keep public workflow contracts stable unless the change is explicitly versioned.
2. Follow `docs/workflow-design-policy.md` for workflow structure and script extraction rules.
3. Run `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`.
4. Parse workflow YAML and check reusable-workflow input compatibility.
5. Run `bash -n` for touched helper scripts.
6. Add or update Bats tests when helper scripts are added or changed.
