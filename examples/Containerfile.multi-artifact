# Example multi-stage Containerfile for combined-app container
# This Containerfile builds all artifacts in separate stages, then combines them

# Stage 1: Build API (Maven)
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build-api
WORKDIR /build
COPY services/api/pom.xml services/api/
COPY services/api/src services/api/src/
RUN cd services/api && mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Build Worker (Maven)
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build-worker
WORKDIR /build
COPY services/worker/pom.xml services/worker/
COPY services/worker/src services/worker/src/
RUN cd services/worker && mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 3: Build Frontend (NPM)
FROM node:22 AS build-web
WORKDIR /build
COPY apps/web/package*.json apps/web/
RUN cd apps/web && npm ci
COPY apps/web/ apps/web/
RUN cd apps/web && npm run build

# Final stage: Runtime with all artifacts
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built artifacts from each stage
COPY --from=build-api /build/services/api/target/*.jar /app/api.jar
COPY --from=build-worker /build/services/worker/target/*.jar /app/worker.jar
COPY --from=build-web /build/apps/web/dist /app/static/

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the main API service
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/api.jar"]
