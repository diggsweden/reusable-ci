# Release Dev Orchestrator
# 
# Purpose: Lightweight orchestrator for development container builds. Provides fast
# feedback loops during development by skipping production security features while
# maintaining basic functionality for testing and development environments.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Triggers on pushes to development branches (develop, feature/*)
# 2. Builds the project (Maven or NPM)
# 3. Creates a single-platform container image
# 4. Pushes to ghcr.io with SHA-based tag (e.g., abc1234-dev)
# 5. Skips all production features (SLSA, SBOM, signing, releases)
#
# Security controls:
# - Minimal - focused on speed over security for development
# - Images clearly marked with -dev suffix
# - No production attestations or signing
#
# Required Secrets:
#   None - uses GITHUB_TOKEN for ghcr.io access
#
# Required Permissions:
#   contents: read   # Read source code
#   packages: write  # Push images to ghcr.io
#
# Differences from Production:
#   - Single platform (linux/amd64) vs multi-platform
#   - SHA tags only (abc1234-dev) vs version tags
#   - No SLSA attestation
#   - No SBOM generation
#   - No vulnerability scanning
#   - No artifact signing
#   - No GitHub release
